            <p>
               This is a virtual pet snail I made using html, css, javascript, and jquery. The page utalizes cursor coordinates so that the user could interact with the snail. <a href="http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~mar528/Pet.html">Here is a link to the virtual pet snail website</a>

            <h2>Dragon Jump Android App</h2>
            <p>
               This is an android application I made that was available for some time on the google play store (got taken down because google play services updated their user agreement that I didn't apply to the game since development was over). The application was an acade-style platformer game, that used google play services to keep track of global highscores and achievements. I used C# and Unity to build the application.

            <h2>CAD/3D Printing</h2>
            <p>
               CAD and 3D printing are one of my favorite hobbies. I've built 3D printers from scratch, 3D printed and prototyped my own designs, and have created a gameboy that running retropie.

            <h2>Artwork</h2>
            <p>
               I love to make art in my free time. I have done the artwork for the virtual pet snail, which is made up of 19 unique animations totaling 66 hand drawn sprites. I also have done all the artwork for the Dragon Jump Android Application.
