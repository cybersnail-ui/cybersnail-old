      <h2>Document Inspiration</h2>
         <p>
            This website is going to be a portfolio of my school work and work experience. A few particular websites I 
            could draw inspiration from are Tumblr, Pinterest, and Instagram. I think that these websites are particularly 
            interesting in that they're able to display a lot of content in a grid-like format whilst not cluttering
            me. Also, The grid-like format makes scrolling on these websites addicting because loading multiple
            content at once is a lot less dauntless then loading content one-by-one. One thing I do not like 
            about these websites is that two fo them (Pinterest, Instagram) look the same and are visually boring
            because it's the typical minimalistic-white-background kind of website. Although Tumblr has a dark blue
            background which is interesting, it's a dull, mucky shade of blue which is very not pleasing to look at.

            Short Descriptor:
            </br></br>My name is Lillian. I'm a college student currently residing in Philly. I am in school for front-end 
            development and will be graduating in just a few years. Outside of school I love pursuing my hobbies such as
            3D modeling, managing and maintaining 3D printers, woodworking, skateboarding, and my favorite which is art. There's a very
            large range of mediums I work with, from material to digital, and I've been learning how to apply these skills to my
            programming projects.

            More About Me:
            </br></br>I first fell in love with computers growing up when I would help out my grandpa fix cash registers for his small 
            buissness. Ever since this experience I've just been fascinated by technology, I've designed and built a robotic hand,
            raspberry pi gameboy, and most recently rebuilt a 3D printer to be contained in an aluminum frame. I'm very methodical
            when approaching these projects, such as drafting many concepts, 3D modeling prototypes, and lots of testing. 

            </br></br>Another special interest I have is programming. The domain of this website is named "cybersnail", because that was one of
            my first huge programming projects, which was creating a webpage containg a virtual pet snail. Another large project I've had
            was creating an android app named "Dragon Jump", which essentially was a doodle-jump-esque retro-arcade-styled android game app.
            This app was hooked up to google play services, so there was a global leaderboards and unlockable achievements. It was also available
            on the google play store for a long period, until google play services updated their policies which was after I've stopped working on
            that project.

            </br></br>I call art my favorite hobby because all of the projects I've worked on is art. From the robotic hand to the android app, everything has
            been built and designed by me. I think that when creating anything, there needs to be a careful balance between form and functionality, or
            else its interest would be lost.
